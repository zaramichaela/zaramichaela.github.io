				In January 2020, I was part of a team that represented Nanyang Polytechnic in a elderly befriending activity held at Bukit Merah View. The elderly at that elder care center
        were relatively lonely we wanted to give them a great experience while we were doing our volunteer work there. We organised it over 5 days, with the activities spanning over
        4 hours per day.
        <br><br>
        For the first day, we played a lot of ice breakers in order to get to know the elderly better. They were initially very hesitant to talk to us but eventually warmed up and welcomed us to have conversations with them.
        <br><br>
        We played many interactive games with them and even had some hands-on crafting activities. We also had a lot of in-depth conversations about their lives and how Singapore was like in the older days.
        Some even shared about their childhood and families.
        <br><br>
        It was an extremely bittersweet moment when we had to go on the last day since the elderly there had gotten quite attached to us and didn't want us to leave. We were proud that had fun, but seeing them ask us not to leave was extremely painful to watch. We decided as a group to visit and volunteer there more often.
        <br><br>
        As of today, I still volunteer there weekly.
